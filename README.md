# Stickleback Whole Genome Sequencing
A guide on many things relating to the processing of WGS of Three Spined Stickleback, but can relate to any genome!

The information used in the processing of this data was produced in the Veeramah lab at Stony Brook University, along with other data from Shanfelter et al. published in 2019.

This guide will include examples of code to process sets of genomic data. Specifically, in our lab's own case, to find freshwater haplotype frequencies in marine populations of three spined sticklebacks.
