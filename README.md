# SticklebackWGS
A guide on many things relating to the processing of WGS of Three Spined Stickleback, but can relate to any genome!

The information used in the processing of this data was produced in the Veeramah lab at Stony Brook University, along with other data
from Shanfelter et al. published in 2019.
